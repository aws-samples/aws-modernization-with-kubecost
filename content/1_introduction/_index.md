# What is Kubecost?

[Kubecost](https://www.kubecost.com/) provides real-time cost visibility and insights for teams using Kubernetes.

Installing Kubecost on a single cluster or a fleet of clusters uncovers patterns that create overspending on infrastructure and helps teams prioritize where to focus optimization efforts. By identifying root causes for negative patterns, customers using Kubecost save up to 80% of their Kubernetes cloud infrastructure costs. Today, Kubecost empowers thousands of teams across companies of all sizes to monitor and reduce costs, while balancing cost, performance, and reliability.

Kubecost is tightly integrated with the open source Cloud Native ecosystem and built for engineers and developers first, making it easy to drive adoption within any organization.

# What is OpenCost?

OpenCost is a vendor-neutral open source project for measuring Kubernetes costs in near real time. The project is a combination of the OpenCost core allocation engine with a new community-driven spec on how to monitor costs in Kubernetes.
