# Launch EKS using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)

[eksctl](https://eksctl.io) is a tool jointly developed by AWS and [Weaveworks](https://weave.works) that automates much of the experience of creating EKS clusters.

In this module, we will use eksctl to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.
