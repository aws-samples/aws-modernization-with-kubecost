In order to delete the resources created for this EKS cluster, run the following commands:

Delete the cluster:

```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name=kubecost-workshop-eksctl
```

{{% notice tip %}}
Without the `--wait` flag, this will only issue a delete operation to the cluster's CloudFormation stack and won't wait for its deletion. The `nodegroup` will have to complete the deletion process before the EKS cluster can be deleted. The total process will take approximately 15 minutes, and can be monitored via the [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
